# UC Berkeley SEMM's Fall 2025 Codebook

This repository was created by Facundo L. Pfeffer to support studying topics from the first semester. Each folder corresponds to a different class.

Quick start:
- Navigate to the class folder you need.
- Read that folder’s README (if any) for context and usage.
- Follow that folder’s requirements.txr for environment/dependency setup.

Notes:
- Each class folder is self-contained. Prefer the README and requirements.txr in that folder for the most accurate instructions.
- This top-level file is only an overview; details live with each class.

## Acknowledgments
