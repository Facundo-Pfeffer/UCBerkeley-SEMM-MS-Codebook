# UC Berkeley SEMM's Fall 2025 Codebook

This repository was created by Facundo L. Pfeffer to support studying topics from the first semester. Each folder corresponds to a different class.

Quick start:
- Navigate to the class folder you need.
- Read that folder’s ```README.md``` (if any) for context and usage.
- Follow that folder’s ```requirements.txt``` for environment/dependency setup.

Notes:
- Each class folder is self-contained. Prefer the ```README.md``` and ```requirements.txt``` in that folder for the most accurate instructions. The usage of virtual enviroments is recommended.
- This top-level file is only an overview; details live with each class.
